 * TALAS — oral reading scorer.
 *
 * Compares what a learner *said* (a transcript, from the Web Speech API online
 * or a manual/offline transcript) against the *expected* passage, word by word,
 * and returns an accuracy score plus a per-word correct/incorrect breakdown.
 *
 * This runs entirely on-device with no network, so scoring works identically
 * offline and online — the only part that may need a connection is the speech
 * recognizer that produces the transcript (handled in `useSpeechRecognition`).
 *
 * Matching strategy: we normalize both sides (lowercase, strip punctuation and
 * Filipino-relevant diacritics), expand hyphenated words into parts, then run a
 * greedy in-order alignment (the same one used for live highlighting) so the
 * final result matches what the learner saw while reading. A skipped word
 * doesn't cascade every later word into "wrong".
